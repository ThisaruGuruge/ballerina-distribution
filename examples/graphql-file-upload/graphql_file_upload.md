# File upload

GraphQL package provides a way to upload files through the GraphQL endpoints with GraphQL mutations. To define an endpoint with the file upload capability, the `graphql:Upload` type can be used as the input parameter of resolver functions.

The in-built `graphql:Upload` type can represent the details of the file that needs to be uploaded and that can be used only with the mutation operations, i.e. remote functions. The value of `graphql:Upload` type is extracted from the HTTP multipart request, which will be received by the GraphQL endpoints. Refer the [Ballerina GraphQL specification](https://ballerina.io/spec/graphql/#6-file-upload) for more information on file upload.

This example shows how to implement a GraphQL endpoint that can be used to upload files.

For more information on the underlying package, see the [GraphQL package](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).

::: code graphql_file_upload.bal :::

Run the service by executing the following command.

::: out graphql_file_upload.server.out :::

To upload a file, send an HTTP multipart request to the GraphQL endpoint using the following cURL command.

The first part of the request is `operations` field that includes a `JSON-encoded` map. This field is similar to a standard HTTP POST request that being sent to a GraphQL endpoint, except where the variable values related to the file upload should be `null`.

The second part of the request is the `map` field, which is a `JSON-encoded` map. It contains a mapping between the variables defined in the first part of the request and the files that are mentioned in the next part. The `key` is used to map a file using the key provided in the next part of the request, and the value is mapped to the variable name defined in the previous part. Multiple variables can have the same file, so the value is an array.

Next part contains the unique key for each file and the path for each file. The `key` in this part should be the same key used in the previous part.

Following is a complete cURL request to send a multipart request to upload files to the GraphQL service.

::: out graphql_file_upload.client.out :::

This will create a directory `uploads` where the service is running, and then saves the `file1.png` inside it.
