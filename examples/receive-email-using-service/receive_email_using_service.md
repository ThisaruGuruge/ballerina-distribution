# Receive emails using a service

The email service is used to receive (with POP3 or IMAP4) emails using the SSL or STARTTLS protocols. This sample includes receiving emails service attached to a POP3 listener with default configurations over SSL using the default ports. To use IMAP4 refer to [`IMAP listener`](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/email/latest/classes/ImapListener).

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`email` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/email/latest/).
