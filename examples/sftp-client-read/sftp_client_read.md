# Client Read

The SFTP client is used to perform CRUD operation on remote files/directories using the SFTP protocol. This sample includes getting a file content with default configurations using the default port number.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`ftp` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/ftp/latest/).
