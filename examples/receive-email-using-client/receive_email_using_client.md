# Receive email using a client

The email client is used to receive (with POP3 or IMAP4) emails using the SSL or STARTTLS protocols. This sample includes receiving emails with default configurations over SSL using the default ports via POP3. Since, IMAP4 has similar syntax we could replace `POP3 client` with [`IMAP client`](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/email/latest/clients/ImapClient).

For more information on the underlying module,  see the [`email` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/email/latest/).
