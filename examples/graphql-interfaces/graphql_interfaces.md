# Interfaces

A GraphQL schema can have interfaces. In Ballerina, interfaces are defined using `distinct` `service` objects and the fields of the interfaces are defined as resource function definitions. Objects that are implementing the interfaces must implement the `resource` methods defined in the service objects. The Ballerina type inclusion is used to include the interface type to an object type.

For more information on the underlying package, see the [GraphQL package](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
