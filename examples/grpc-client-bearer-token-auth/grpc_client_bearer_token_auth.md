# Bearer token auth client

A client, which is secured with Bearer token auth can be used to connect to a secured service.

The client metadata is enriched with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header by passing the `grpc:BearerTokenConfig` for the `auth` configuration of the client.

>**Info:** For more information on the underlying module, see the [`auth` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/auth/latest).

>**Info:** You can refer to the [simple RPC client](/learn/by-example/grpc-client-simple/) to implement the client used below.

>**Info:** As a prerequisite to running the client, start a secured sample service.
